Concrete binary floating-point types, part 2
============================================

## Floating-point precision

Swift's floating-point types are intended to model the real numbers, but (as
with all such models) it is inexact; in fact, almost all real numbers cannot be
represented exactly in binary floating-point format.

> _Background:_
>
> Even for beginners, some caveats can be important to keep in mind when working
> with binary floating-point values:
>
> * Many modest decimal fractions, such as 0.1, cannot be represented exactly.
> * Many integral values less than `greatestFiniteMagnitude` cannot be
>   represented exactly.
> * Basic arithmetic operations are often inexact; for example, `a + b - b == a`
>   does not always evaluate to `true`.

Although out the scope of this article, some alternative choices for modeling
real numbers are as follows:

> __Binary floating point__  
> Pro: represents modest integers exactly, extremely fast hardware
> implementations, fixed memory size, and rounding errors are extremely
> uniform—they don't vary much with the number being represented.  
> Con: almost no decimal fractions have exact representations.
>
> __Decimal floating point__  
> Pro: represents modest integers and decimal fractions exactly, slower than
> binary but still faster than almost anything else, fixed memory size.  
> Con: at least an order of magnitude slower than binary floating point, and
> rounding error is significantly less scale-invariant.
>
> __Fixed-size rationals__  
> Pro: represents all modestly-sized integers and fractions exactly, fixed
> memory size, four basic operations are exact until you hit the limits of
> representation.  
> Con: denominators quickly grow too quickly to be used for non-trivial
> computations (this is usually a deal-breaker).
>
> __Arbitrary-precision rationals__  
> Pro: closed under four basic operations, represents most numbers most people
> will use exactly.  
> Con: representations get extremely large extremely quickly, large memory
> footprint if you have more than a few numbers.
>
> __Computable real numbers__  
> Pro: any number you can describe, you can work with.  
> Con: your numbers are now computer programs, and you arithmetic system is
> Turing-complete. Testing for equality is equivalent to solving the halting
> problem.

The Swift standard library provides binary floating-point types. Foundation
offers a decimal floating-point type discussed later; alternative
implementations that adhere to IEEE 754, such as those from [IBM][ref 12-3] (ICU
License) or [Intel][ref 12-4] (BSD License), can be wrapped in Swift.
Third-party libraries can provide a [fixed-width rational type][ref 12-5], and
existing libraries with C interfaces can be wrapped to provide an
arbitrary-precision rational type (or one can be implemented natively in Swift).

### Striding

> _Background:_
>
> As would occur in any other language, repeated addition of a `stride` amount
> to a binary floating-point value can cause accumulation of rounding error. For
> instance:
> 
> ``` swift
> let stride = 0.1
> var x = 1.0
> 
> x += stride
> x += stride
> print(x - 1.2)  // 2.2204460492503131e-16
> 
> x += stride
> x += stride
> print(x - 1.4)  // 4.4408920985006262e-16

In Swift 4.0, `stride(from: 1.0, to: 2.0, by: 0.1)` avoids accumulation of
rounding error by instead computing the sequence of values as follows: `1.0`,
`1.0 + 1.0 * 0.1`, `1.0 + 2.0 * 0.1`, `1.0 + 3.0 * 0.1`...

Although this method of computing the sequence avoids an undesired artifact,
users should nonetheless be aware that the result will not be equivalent to that
obtained by repeated addition.

### Fused multiply-add

In Swift 4.0, the sequence `stride(from: -0.2, through: 1.0, by: 0.2)` does not
include the value `1.0`.

Despite avoiding accumulated rounding error from repeated addition, the
expression `-0.2 + 6.0 * 0.2` evaluates to `1.0000000000000002` due to
intermediate rounding error.

The IEEE 754 operation __fusedMultiplyAdd__ allows the same computation to be
performed in one step with a single rounding, improving the accuracy of the
result. This operation is available in Swift as the instance method
`addingProduct(_:_:)`. For example:

```swift
-0.2 + 6.0 * 0.2               // 1.0000000000000002
(-0.2).addingProduct(6.0, 0.2) // 1
```

By altering the implementation of `stride(from:through:by:)` in Swift 4.1 to
use the fused multiply-add operation, the sequence
`stride(from: -0.2, through: 1.0, by: 0.2)` now includes the value `1.0`.

> The fusedMultiplyAdd operation was added to Swift as part of the Swift
> Evolution proposal [SE-0067: Enhanced floating-point protocols][ref 11-9].
> Intermediate rounding error in floating-point strides was eliminated in the
> Swift standard library in [late 2017][ref 12-6].

__A brief caveat about fused multiply-add operations:__ Although eliminating
intermediate rounding can improve the accuracy of results, it is not always the
case that an algorithm will benefit from its use. [William Kahan points
out][ref 12-7] that, for a sufficiently large value `a`, we observe:

```swift
let a = 9007199254740991.0
(a * a - a * a).squareRoot()              // 0, as expected
(a * a).addingProduct(-a, a).squareRoot() // nan
```

This result is observed because `a * a` cannot be represented exactly as a value
of type `Double`. In fact, `(a * a).addingProduct(-a, a)` actually computes the
amount by which `a * a` is inexact. Since `a * a` is rounded down, that amount
is negative, and therefore taking the square root gives NaN.

### Approximating π

In Swift, each floating-point type has a static property `pi` that provides the
value for π at its best possible precision, accurately __rounded toward zero__.

The purpose of rounding toward zero is to avoid angles computed in radians
from being rounded to a different quadrant. As a consequence,
`Float.pi < Float(Double.pi)` evaluates to `true`.

### Subnormal values on 32-bit ARM

> _Background:_
>
> In the gap between zero and 2<sup><em>emin</em></sup>, where _emin_ is the
> minimum supported exponent of a binary floating-point type, a set of linearly
> spaced [__subnormal__ (or denormal) values][ref 12-8] can be represented with
> some differences in their binary representation as compared to that of
> __normal__ finite values.
>
> On 32-bit ARMv7, the vector floating-point (VFP) co-processor supports a
> __flush-to-zero (FZ) mode__ for floating-point operations that is not
> compliant with IEEE 754. When the FZ bit is set, operations that would
> otherwise return a subnormal value instead return zero. Meanwhile, the NEON
> SIMD co-processor on ARMv7 always uses flush-to-zero mode regardless of the FZ
> bit.

For iOS platforms, it is possible in C to clear the ARMv7 FZ bit using inline
assembler; however, doing so has a negative effect on performance. As Swift does
not support inline assembler, it is not possible to disable flush-to-zero mode
from Swift.

On 32-bit ARM, Swift floating-point types skip subnormal values. For example,
`(0 as Double).nextUp` evaluates to the least normal magnitude and
`(0 as Double).ulp` evaluates to zero.
